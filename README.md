# Attendance-Report-Dashboard.pbi
This is an **Employee Attendance Dashboard** for *OneTick Career Development Company*, providing a detailed analysis of employee attendance records, absences, and weekly summaries.

**Key Features:**
1. **Employee List & Search:**
   - A list of employees on the left with a search option for filtering.

2. **Attendance Record Section:**
   - Displays attendance percentages for different months.
   - **Presence and absence percentages** appear inflated (e.g., *1810% for Feb Present, 8954% for Apr Absent*), possibly due to a calculation issue.

3. **Weekly Record Section:**
   - **Total Present Records:** 3,816 (1970%)  
   - **Total Absent Records:** 17,412 (8969%)  
   - **Total Present (No Out Punch):** 2,440 (1261%)  
   - These high percentages indicate **possible data inconsistencies or an issue in formula calculations.**

4. **Employee Attendance Table:**
   - Lists attendance details for individual employees.
   - Includes **"Present," "Absent," and "Present (No OutPunch)"** records.
   - Example: **Dharmender** has *4 presents, 38 absents, and 55 no-out punch records*.

**Observations & Recommendations:**
- The **percentage values** seem **unrealistically high** (likely a formula error).  
- The **No Out Punch category** suggests employees might be forgetting to log out, which could be improved with reminders or an automated system.  
- The **searchable employee list** helps in filtering individual attendance records.  
- A **graphical representation** (bar or pie charts) could make it easier to visualize trends.  

This dashboard effectively tracks attendance but needs some refinements for accurate representation.
